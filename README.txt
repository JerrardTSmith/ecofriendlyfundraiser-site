Thank you for your contribution to the fundraiser.

Please remember to follow the workflow:

Trello Board:
  Use cards to indiciate 
  a) what feature is being worked on,
  b) what feature remains to be worked on,
  c) what feature is complete.
 
 Git:
  Use git create your branch by using 
  git checkout -b <branchname> to create and enter a new branch
  
  After making changes, use git add --all to add all new/changed files + directories
  or use "git add ." to add all new/changed files only
  or use "git add <filename>" to add only a new/changed file to the update.
  
  Make meaningful commits using "git commit -m "message". Typically, you'd commit after a feature is updated or changed.
  Always use commit after "git add".
  
  Push the changes to your branch by using "git push origin <branchname>". 
  
  After each change the cycle of git add + git commit +
  git push repeats.
  
  *After your first commit, be sure to immediately make a pull request by going to the github repo 
  @ https://github.com/Balcony-Visions/ecofriendly-wordpress and clicking "new pull request".
  
  Once your changes are approved, they will be added to the master. Otherwise, you will be contacted with changes that must take
  place before your changes can be merged to the master branch.
 
 Slack:
  Enter into the #Standup channel and leave a message describing 
  a) what was completed by you yesterday,
  b) what was completed by you today,
  c) any blockers or problems that you ran into today.
